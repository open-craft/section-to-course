0001 Purpose of This Repo

Status

**Draft**

Context
*******

Harvard Medical School intends to take existing course sections and turn them into independent courses. An existing project, Modular Learning, is in planning to support handling of sections as independent pieces of content. However, this functionality is not yet built and generally available, and Harvard Medical School's business needs mandate a solution be created in the interim.

Decision
********

We will create a repository to enable reuse of course sections as new courses.

Consequences
************

It will be possible to lift a section from a course and turn it into a new course. Further, this application will allow refreshing of the resulting course based on modified lesson information.

Future work will be required to migrate the functionality of this application into the completed Modular Learning solution. It is not clear that any code from this project will be reused in the Modular Learning solution. However, it is likely that practical lessons from its use will be useful in designing Modular Learning.

Rejected Alternatives
*********************

Waiting for the completed Modular Learning solution is not an option. The business needs of Harvard Medical School require a solution now.

Designing a strong candidate for the Modular Learning project was also not an option, as designing a candidate implementation would require considerable research and design-- it is better to leave the existing research and design process to the Modular Learning team, as the implications are far wider reaching than this project.
